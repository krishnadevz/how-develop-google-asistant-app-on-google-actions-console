# here are steps to develop google assistant app

In this article, I will be showing you, how you can develop your very own Google Assistant app in less than 5 minutes. And the best part is, you don’t require any coding for this. So, if you have an idea for a Google Assistant app, and don’t know how to code, you can follow this article and develop a Trivia, Personality Quiz, or a Flash Card based Google Assistant app. All you need to do is follow the instructions

In the following steps, I will show you how to create a project in Action on Google console and link it with Google Sheet which will be acting as the corpus for your Google Assistant app.

1.Steps:

    To start with, in the browser login to Actions on Google console. Open http://developers.google.com/actions and log in with your Google Account credentials.
    
    2.Click on the “Add/import project” and provide the project details like “Project name” and “Country/region”. Once done, click “Create Project” to create an Action on Google project.
    
    3. After creating the project successfully, you will be presented with different category options for pre-built agents. Scroll down and select “Templates” under “More options”
    
    4. You will be shown template options like for “Trivia”, “Personality quiz”, and “Flash cards”. Depending on your choice of app select the template. For this demo, I will be selecting “Trivia”.
    
    5. Now, click on the “Actions” and “Add your first action”
    
    6. Choose the language your app will support in the dialog window. Then select the template (“Trivia” in our case) and click “Build” to proceed.

7. Select the personality for your app “Agent”. This will decide how the agent will communicate with your users. You can even test these and see how they sound and behave before selecting. Once done, click “Next”. according to your perspective.

8. Now, we will link coonect  from the Google Sheet with our app. Click the “Bulk upload the content…” and follow the steps shown in the dialog window.

a. Make a copy of the template Google Sheet.
b. Edit and add your corpus data — Question and Answer options in our case.
c. Save and share/copy the corpus link.

9. Paste the Google Sheet link and click “Upload” to link the corpus. If successfully linked, click “Create App” to build the Google Assistant app.

10. As soon as the app is created, you will be automatically routed to Google Assistant Simulator. Here you can test your app by clicking “Test App” and then selecting the draft version. and adding some other details in the app then you can publish your app.
